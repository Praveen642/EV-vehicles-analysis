# EV-vehicles-analysis

📊 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to Electric Vehicles (EVs) using Power BI. The goal is to uncover insights into EV adoption trends, charging infrastructure, manufacturer performance, and regional distribution. The dashboard provides an interactive and data-driven view of key metrics to support decision-making in the EV industry.

📂 Dataset

Source: Public EV dataset (e.g., Kaggle or government EV registry)
Contents:
Vehicle specifications (make, model, type, range, price)
Registration data (state, city, year)
Charging station availability
Energy consumption and CO₂ savings.

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Collection
Imported raw EV dataset into Power BI.

Data Cleaning
Removed duplicates and handled missing values using Power Query.

Data Transformation
Created relationships between tables (vehicle specs, registrations, charging stations).

Data Modeling
Added calculated columns and measures using DAX for metrics like total EVs, average range, and growth rate.

Visualization Development
Designed interactive visuals (maps, bar charts, KPIs, slicers) for user-friendly exploration.

Dashboard Design
Organized visuals into a cohesive, story-driven dashboard layout.
